                    Sudan has strong mechanisms in place for scaling up nutrition. The established multi-sectoral platform (MSP) for nutrition includes the Higher Council of Food Security and Nutrition, which convenes 13 line ministries, whilst the National Nutrition Programme Office (NNP) of the Ministry of Health is responsible for coordination and reports to the President through the Vice-President and the National Nutrition Committee (NNC). The NCC engages with stakeholders including the private sector, civil society, UN agencies, development partners and academia. Sudan has developed advocacy tools and a decentralisation plan to districts, complemented by district and community-level coordination structures.
